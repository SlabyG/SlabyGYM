Wireframes unable to load due to incorect code for wireframes and wrong format | Created a new folder in the wireframes called pc. In this folder i had to use Snipping Tool to convert&divide each wireframe individualy into a PNG format from the Balsamiq files and i had to rename each of the wireframe files to come in the appropriate order (1-7). Code unable to load the frames as was missing ! from front of the code and it had wrong file format. [link](/assets/testings/PNG.PNG)
Index.html, css, hover, bootstrap links checked to see if they are functioning | fully functioning [bootstrap test](/assets/testings/links.PNG)
Overall Website performance was at 91% | Hero Img was of a large file. converted the file via TinyPNG and then re-compressed via Compressor.io and set it used it as a pic instead of URL which brought the score between 96%-99%.
Iframe was not working properly due to an error | i posted on slack comunity on /ask-us-anything Eventyret_mentor sugested the URL link is wrong. then i googled how to obtain the correct url link for the google map. [Error link](/assets/testings/error1-iframe.PNG)
Screen reader users rely on frame titles to describe the contents of frames. | added a new title to all .html [Iframe error](/assets/testings/html-iframe.PNG)
lighthouse score for SEO of 92 | added a meta link with name and content to boost search engine maximization.
hero image | the picture size has been compressed several times. each time when lighthouse is run it states that the picture can still be compressed even more. if picture is compresed more it will have a bad quality. issue not fixed
