Wireframes unable to load due to incorect code for wireframes and wrong format | Created a new folder in the wireframes called pc. In this folder i had to use Snipping Tool to convert&divide each wireframe individualy into a PNG format from the Balsamiq files and i had to rename each of the wireframe files to come in the appropriate order (1-7). Code unable to load the frames as was missing ! from front of the code and it had wrong file format. ![test](/assets/testings/PNG.PNG)
